# Problem

Residents, unaware of what changes are occurring throughout the city and are unaware of the tools the city provides.


# Solution(s)

* Encourage city to develop social media, traditional media, postering/quarter-sheets, and in-person events to get the word out
* Build a tool/process to highlight a rarely used service via city and representative social media


# Effectiveness Measure

* Survey 200 - 250 residents in various locations before changes are made and after changes are made.
* Ask residents if:
  * They know about any of the tools
  * Where they learned about them
  * If they've used them
* Compare results and improve
