_Let's watch a talk_

[The Antitode to Apathy - Dave Meslin ](http://www.ted.com/talks/dave_meslin_the_antidote_to_apathy?language=en)



# Let's Be Un-apathetic

* What problems do you see in Athens?
* How can we solve them?
* How do we know if we've solved the problem?



# Let's Document our Plans

* Edit the repo <https://github.com/AthensWorks/AthensCivicHack>
* Add your ideas to the `ideas/` folder
  * State the problem
  * State the solution
  * State the way to measure the effectiveness


# Regroup in 45 Mins

*We will pick some project(s) and go from there*



# Go!
